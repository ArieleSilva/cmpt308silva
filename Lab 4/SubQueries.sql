Check constraints are basically parameters set to limit the amount 
of values within one or more columns. They are good for narrowing 
down the options for a particular answer, by using check constraints
 against other tables / columns / rows we can get a more specific 
 answer than a broad one. The advantages of putting check constraints 
 inside databases is that it will make writing subqueries easier by being
 more specific. It also makes sure that we are precise when writing our 
 queries. A good use of check constraints would be to make sure that all
 of the queries written are consistent in itâ€™s case sensitivity. A bad 
 example would be that since check constraints are in place, it will not
 accept negative values and if there is a case sensitive typo, the output
 will not be accurate.
